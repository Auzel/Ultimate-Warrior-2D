# Ultimate-Warrior-2D v1.0
The Ultimate Warrior 2D game provides gameplayers with an enthralling and captivating experience where they can use of one of three warriors to progress through the ranks by defeating all other warriors until the player becomes the Ultimate Warrior.

## Story
The player begins the game with a low-skilled warrior. His aim is to traverse through the dungeon to unlock the prison cell of another warrior who he aims to defeat. Moving guards and dogs would constantly try to derail the player’s attempts. If the user is able to unlock the cell of another warrior, the user enters a one-on-one brawl with it. If the player wins, he gains XP and upgrades in his warrior’s abilities; otherwise, the players loses and the game ends.

## Gameplay
The game begins as a side-scrolling game where the player can move his warrior in left and right directions in order to traverse the dungeon. His warrior can be jump, run, walk and attack to evade guards, and dogs (which attacks the player upon approach). Whilst a warrior cannot necessarily fly, the game allows for the combination of arrow keys and a powerful jump to give the effect of a short flight. 

The player’s aim is to traverse through the dungeon to unlock the prison cell of another warrior who he aims to defeat. At that moment, the game switches from the side-scrolling section of the game to a fixed (stationary) game in a different location where the player fights one-on-one with the warrior he freed from the cell. The two warriors fight using their skill moves and weapons. Each hit on a warrior causes him to lose a certain amount of health, depending on the move. Whichever warrior’s health reaches 0 first, it dies and the other warrior wins. If the player wins, then he increases his experience points (XP) and warrior’s abilities. The game then shifts back to the side-scrolling section of the game where the player can then try to unlock another warrior’s cell. If, however, the player is defeated in battle, his XP points is displayed and the game ends.

Note: Various players can compete amongst themselves by comparing XP scores. In the next release, higher levels in the game will have greater difficulty, where dogs, guards, and imprisoned warriors are bigger, faster, stronger and dies less easily.

### Dogs
These will also take the form of animation. These would be persons, decked in a security guard uniform, positioned outside of an imprisoned warrior’s cell. They possess batons and patrol the area near the cell. When a guard hits a warrior with a baton, the warrior loses a 1/3 of its health. However, if a warrior hits a guard, the guard instantly dies.
